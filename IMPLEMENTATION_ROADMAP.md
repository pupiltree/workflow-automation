- **Multi-modal AI integration** (text, voice, research, analytics)
- **Real-time processing** requirements with SLA guarantees
- **Complex human-AI collaboration** workflows
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with strict data isolation

### Critical Dependencies
```
Foundation Layer → Core Workflow → Advanced AI → Optimization → Production Excellence
     ↓               ↓              ↓           ↓              ↓
Infrastructure → Research → Voice AI → Analytics → Enterprise Features
Authentication → Demo Gen → PRD Builder → Monitoring → Advanced Security
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Technology Risk**: Start with proven frameworks (LangGraph, LiveKit)
- **Timeline Risk**: MVP-first approach with iterative delivery
- **Integration Risk**: Comprehensive API testing and standardization
- **Performance Risk**: Horizontal scaling design from day one
- **Security Risk**: Security-by-design with regular audits
