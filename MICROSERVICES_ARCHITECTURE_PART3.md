# Microservices Architecture Specification (Part 3 - Final)
## Complete Workflow Automation System - Core Runtime & Support Services

---

## 8. Agent Orchestration Service

#### Objectives
- **Primary Purpose**: Core LangGraph-based orchestration engine that powers all chatbot/voicebot workflows using dynamic YAML configurations
- **Business Value**: Enables multi-tenant agent deployment with configuration-driven behavior, supports 10,000+ concurrent conversations, 99.9% uptime
- **Scope Boundaries**:
  - **Does**: Load YAML configs, orchestrate multi-agent workflows, manage conversation state, execute tools, handle escalations
  - **Does Not**: Generate configs (Automation Engine does), implement tools (developers do), manage voice infrastructure

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Load and hot-reload YAML configs per tenant
2. Implement LangGraph two-node workflow (agent node + tools node)
3. Manage conversation state with PostgreSQL checkpointing
4. Execute tools based on YAML config
5. Handle human escalation triggers
6. Support multi-turn conversations with memory management
7. Implement PII collection and storage
8. Enable cross-sell/upsell based on config
9. Concurrent conversation handling (1000+ per instance)

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Response time: <2s P95 latency for chatbot
- Checkpoint persistence: <100ms
- Tool execution timeout: 30s with graceful fallback
- Memory management: Compress context >10K tokens
- Horizontal scalability: 1000+ conversations per pod

**Dependencies:**
- Automation Engine (YAML config source)
- Configuration Management (config distribution)
- LLM Gateway Service (model inference)
- RAG Pipeline Service (knowledge retrieval)
- CRM Integration Service (tool execution)
- Supabase PostgreSQL (state checkpoints, conversation logs)

**Data Storage:**
- PostgreSQL: Conversation threads, checkpoints, PII data, analytics events
- Redis: Short-term memory cache, active session state
- Pinecone: Long-term memory (user preferences, historical facts)

#### Features

**Must-Have:**
1. âœ… YAML-driven agent configuration
2. âœ… LangGraph two-node orchestration (agent + tools)
3. âœ… State checkpointing with fault tolerance
4. âœ… Tool execution framework (dynamic tool loading)
5. âœ… Human escalation workflows
6. âœ… PII collection and storage
7. âœ… Cross-sell/upsell execution
8. âœ… Memory management (short-term + long-term)
9. âœ… Multi-tenant isolation

**Nice-to-Have:**
10. ðŸ”„ Autonomous agents with planning capabilities
11. ðŸ”„ Multi-agent collaboration (supervisor-worker patterns)
12. ðŸ”„ Streaming responses with tool call visibility
13. ðŸ”„ Context window optimization (RAG-based retrieval)

**Feature Interactions:**
- Config hot-reload â†’ Gracefully updates agent behavior mid-conversation
- Tool execution failure â†’ Fallback to alternative tool or escalate
- PII detected â†’ Auto-store with encryption, update user profile

   - Workflows: Investigates failures, optimizes performance, deploys config updates

**AI Agents:**

1. **LangGraph Agent (Primary)**
   - Responsibility: Conducts conversations, invokes tools, manages state
   - Tools: Dynamic (loaded from YAML config)
   - Autonomy: Fully autonomous within config constraints
   - Escalation: Human handoff triggered by config rules (sentiment, complexity, user request)

2. **Memory Management Agent**

## Inter-Service Communication Patterns

### Event-Driven (Primary)

**Kafka Topics:**
- `client_events`: Research completed, NDA signed, pilot agreed
- `demo_events`: Demo generated, approved, failed
- `prd_events`: PRD created, approved, updated
- `config_events`: Config generated, deployed, hot-reloaded
- `conversation_events`: Started, escalated, completed
- `voice_events`: Call initiated, transferred, ended
- `analytics_events`: KPIs calculated, experiments completed
- `monitoring_events`: Incidents created, resolved
- `escalation_events`: Human handoff triggered

### Synchronous REST (Secondary)

**Use Cases:**
- User-facing operations (demo generation, proposal creation)
- External integrations (CRM sync, e-signature)
- Admin operations (config validation, incident creation)

### gRPC (Internal High-Performance)

**Use Cases:**
- Agent-to-tool communication
- Service mesh data plane
- High-frequency metric collection

---

## Deployment & Infrastructure Considerations

### Kubernetes Architecture

**Namespace Strategy:**
- `core-services`: Research, Demo, NDA, Pricing, Proposal, PRD, Automation
- `runtime-services`: Agent Orchestration, Voice, Configuration Management
- `support-services`: Monitoring, Analytics, Customer Success, Support, CRM
- `infrastructure`: Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, Vector DBs
- `tenants-staging`: Tenant-specific staging environments
- `tenants-prod`: Tenant-specific production (enterprise tier)

### Scaling Strategy

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
- Agent Orchestration: CPU 70%, custom metric (active conversations)
- Voice Agent: GPU utilization 60%, queue depth
- API Gateway (Kong): Request rate, P95 latency
- Analytics: Kafka lag, processing queue depth

**Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA):**
- LLM Gateway: Memory-intensive (model loading)
- RAG Pipeline: Memory for embedding caching

**Cluster Autoscaling (Karpenter):**
- GPU nodes for voice workers (T4 instances)
- Spot instances for batch analytics
- Reserved instances for core services

### Database Architecture

**PostgreSQL (Supabase) - Shared Core:**
- Authentication and authorization (auth.users)
- Billing and subscriptions
- Cross-service metadata

**PostgreSQL - Per Service:**
- Agent Orchestration: Conversations, checkpoints
- Voice: Call metadata, transcripts
- Analytics: Aggregated metrics, experiments
- Monitoring: Incidents, alerts

**Citus Sharding (>10K tenants):**
- Shard key: tenant_id
- Schema-per-tenant for compliance isolation

### Caching Strategy

**L1 (In-Memory per Pod):**
- Config: YAML configs, feature flags
- Static: Prompt templates, tool schemas

**L2 (Redis Cluster):**
- Session state, rate limit counters
- LLM response cache (60min TTL)
- Hot configuration data

**L3 (CDN - Cloudflare):**
- Static assets (JS bundles, images)
- Public API responses (anonymized)

---

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

**Encryption:**
- At Rest: AES-256 (KMS-managed keys, tenant-specific for enterprise)
- In Transit: TLS 1.3 (mTLS for service mesh)
- PII: Separate encryption keys, automatic rotation (90 days)

**Access Control:**
- Kong API Gateway: JWT-based auth, tenant_id validation
- Linkerd Service Mesh: mTLS for inter-service communication
- PostgreSQL RLS: tenant_id filtering on every query
- S3: Bucket policies, IAM roles with least privilege

### Compliance Frameworks

**SOC 2 Type II:**
- Comprehensive audit logging (Kafka event sourcing)
- Security policies documented and enforced
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual third-party audit

**HIPAA (Healthcare Tenants):**
- Dedicated infrastructure (physical isolation)
- BAA with all service providers
- 6-year audit log retention
- Encrypted PHI at rest and in transit

**GDPR (EU Operations):**
- Data residency (GCP europe-west1, AWS eu-central-1)
- Right to erasure (30-day data deletion)
- Data portability (JSON export)
- Consent management for optional processing

**PCI-DSS (Payment Processing):**
- Tokenization (no card data storage)
- Network segmentation
- Quarterly vulnerability scans
- Two-factor authentication for admin access

### Incident Response

**Detection:**
- Real-time anomaly detection (Datadog Security)
- Failed auth alerts (>10 failures in 5min)
- Unusual data access (ML-based patterns)
- DDoS protection (Cloudflare WAF)

**Response Playbook:**
1. Containment (isolate affected systems, revoke credentials)
2. Forensics (preserve logs, identify attack vector)
3. Notification (72hr GDPR, 60-day HIPAA)
4. Remediation (patch vulnerabilities, update policies)
5. Post-Incident Review (RCA, preventive measures)

**Disaster Recovery:**
- Multi-region deployment (active-passive)
- Database backups every 4 hours (PITR)
- Config backups to separate region
- Quarterly DR drills
- RTO: <5min, RPO: <15min
