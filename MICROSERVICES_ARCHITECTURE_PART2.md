# Microservices Architecture Specification (Part 2)
## Complete Workflow Automation System - Remaining Services

---

## 6. PRD Builder Engine Service

#### Objectives
- **Primary Purpose**: AI-powered generation of comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) through conversational interface with cross-questioning and village knowledge integration
- **Business Value**: Reduces PRD creation from 20+ hours to 2-3 hours, leverages multi-client learnings, ensures completeness through AI-driven edge case analysis
- **Scope Boundaries**:
  - **Does**: Generate PRDs via webchat UI, integrate village knowledge, suggest new objectives, design A/B flows, plan integrations and escalations
  - **Does Not**: Write code, deploy solutions, manage infrastructure

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Conversational PRD generation via webchat UI with cross-questioning
2. Integration with village knowledge (what's working for other clients)
3. Automatic objective suggestion based on business context and AI intelligence
4. A/B flow design for each objective with KPI measurement framework
5. Baseline data requirement assessment (what data exists, what's needed)
6. Integration architecture definition (when to escalate, tool ecosystem mapping)
7. Sprint planning with 95% automation roadmap (12-month timeline)
8. Log event tracking for uptime monitoring
9. Iterative refinement until client satisfaction

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Initial PRD generation: <15 minutes for standard use case
- Support 50 concurrent PRD sessions
- Village knowledge retrieval: <2s latency
- 99% uptime for PRD generation service
- Multi-client knowledge isolation (no data leakage)

**Dependencies:**
- Proposal Generator (consumes proposal_signed event)
- Agent Orchestration Service (village knowledge retrieval)
- Automation Engine (triggers YAML config generation)
- Analytics Service (historical KPI data for benchmarking)

**Data Storage:**
- PostgreSQL: PRD metadata, versions, client feedback, approval status
- Qdrant: Village knowledge embeddings (successful patterns, KPIs, flows)
- Neo4j: Integration dependency graphs, workflow relationships
- S3: PRD documents (markdown, PDF exports)

#### Features

**Must-Have:**
1. âœ… Conversational PRD builder with AI cross-questioning
2. âœ… Village knowledge integration (multi-tenant learnings)
3. âœ… Objective suggestion engine (cross-sell, upsell, surveys)
4. âœ… A/B flow designer with visual workflow builder
5. âœ… KPI framework definition with baseline assessment
6. âœ… Integration architecture planner (escalation rules, tool mapping)
7. âœ… Sprint roadmap generator (12-month automation plan)
8. âœ… Collaborative editing with client feedback loop

**Nice-to-Have:**
9. ðŸ”„ Auto-generated user stories from PRD
10. ðŸ”„ Competitive analysis integration
11. ðŸ”„ Risk assessment and mitigation planning
12. ðŸ”„ ROI calculator based on automation metrics

**Feature Interactions:**
- Proposal signing â†’ Auto-triggers PRD session
- PRD approval â†’ Triggers automation engine YAML generation
- Village knowledge â†’ Suggests objectives client didn't request
