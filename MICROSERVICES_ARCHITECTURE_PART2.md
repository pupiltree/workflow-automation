# Microservices Architecture Specification (Part 2)
## Complete Workflow Automation System - Remaining Services

## 6. PRD Builder Engine Service

#### Objectives
- **Primary Purpose**: AI-powered generation of comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for chatbot and voicebot products through conversational interface with cross-questioning and village knowledge integration
- **Business Value**: Reduces PRD creation from 20+ hours to 2-3 hours, leverages multi-client learnings, ensures completeness through AI-driven edge case analysis
- **Product Differentiation**: Supports both chatbot (LangGraph-based) and voicebot (LiveKit-based) product types with product-specific requirements, sprint planning, and integration architecture
- **Scope Boundaries**:
  - **Does**: Generate PRDs via webchat UI, integrate village knowledge, suggest new objectives, design A/B flows, plan integrations and escalations, differentiate chatbot vs voicebot requirements
  - **Does Not**: Write code, deploy solutions, manage infrastructure

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Conversational PRD generation via webchat UI with cross-questioning
2. Integration with village knowledge (what's working for other clients)
3. Automatic objective suggestion based on business context and AI intelligence
4. A/B flow design for each objective with KPI measurement framework
5. Baseline data requirement assessment (what data exists, what's needed)
6. Integration architecture definition (when to escalate, tool ecosystem mapping)
7. Sprint planning with 95% automation roadmap (12-month timeline)
8. Log event tracking for uptime monitoring
9. Iterative refinement until client satisfaction

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Initial PRD generation: <15 minutes for standard use case
- Support 50 concurrent PRD sessions
- Village knowledge retrieval: <2s latency
- 99% uptime for PRD generation service
- Multi-client knowledge isolation (no data leakage)

**Dependencies:**
- **NDA Generator** (consumes nda_fully_signed event to trigger PRD session)
- **Demo Generator** (demo data provides use case context for PRD)
- **Research Engine** (volume predictions inform PRD volume requirements)
- Agent Orchestration Service (village knowledge retrieval)
- **Pricing Model Generator** (PRD approval triggers pricing generation via prd_approved event)
- Analytics Service (historical KPI data for benchmarking)

**Data Storage:**
- PostgreSQL: PRD metadata, versions, client feedback, approval status
- Qdrant: Village knowledge embeddings (successful patterns, KPIs, flows)
- Neo4j: Integration dependency graphs, workflow relationships
- S3: PRD documents (markdown, PDF exports)

#### Features

**Must-Have:**
1. âœ… Conversational PRD builder with AI cross-questioning
2. âœ… Village knowledge integration (multi-tenant learnings)
3. âœ… Objective suggestion engine (cross-sell, upsell, surveys)
4. âœ… A/B flow designer with visual workflow builder
5. âœ… KPI framework definition with baseline assessment
6. âœ… Integration architecture planner (escalation rules, tool mapping)
7. âœ… Sprint roadmap generator (12-month automation plan)
8. âœ… Collaborative editing with client feedback loop
9. âœ… **Help button with shareable code generation** (expiring codes for human agent collaboration)
10. âœ… **Real-time collaborative canvas** (multi-user editing with cursor tracking)
11. âœ… **Human agent join capability** (agents can join PRD sessions to help clients)
12. âœ… **Collaboration chat** (side-by-side chat during PRD building)

**Nice-to-Have:**
13. ðŸ”„ Auto-generated user stories from PRD
14. ðŸ”„ Competitive analysis integration
15. ðŸ”„ Risk assessment and mitigation planning
16. ðŸ”„ ROI calculator based on automation metrics

**Feature Interactions:**
- NDA signing â†’ Auto-triggers PRD session (consumes nda_fully_signed event)
- PRD approval â†’ Triggers pricing model generation (publishes prd_approved event to prd_events topic)
- Pricing completion â†’ Proposal generation uses both PRD and pricing data
- Village knowledge â†’ Suggests objectives client didn't request
- Help button clicked â†’ Generates shareable code â†’ Publishes help_requested event â†’ Human agent joins â†’ Real-time collaboration begins
- Collaboration ended â†’ Session resumes with AI PRD builder â†’ Client continues independently
- Requirements form data â†’ Validates client-stated volumes against PRD technical requirements

## 7. Automation Engine Service

#### Objectives
- **Primary Purpose**: Converts approved PRDs into executable YAML configurations, manages dynamic agent behavior, orchestrates tool and integration lifecycle
- **Business Value**: Enables configuration-driven agent deployment, automates GitHub issue creation for missing tools/integrations, supports 1000+ concurrent YAML configs
- **Scope Boundaries**:
  - **Does**: Generate YAML configs, manage tool/integration GitHub issues, hot-reload configurations, validate and version configs
  - **Does Not**: Implement tools/integrations (developers do), train models, deploy infrastructure

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Generate YAML configuration from approved PRD with webchat UI interface
2. Define system prompts, tools, integrations, and metadata per config
3. Auto-create GitHub issues for missing tools/integrations with detailed specs
4. Track tool/integration implementation status and auto-update configs
5. Validate YAML against JSON Schema before deployment
6. Support config versioning with blue-green deployment
7. Hot-reload configs without service restart
8. Multi-tenant config isolation with namespace-based segregation

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- YAML generation: <5 minutes from PRD approval
- Config validation: <2 seconds
- Hot-reload propagation: <60 seconds across all services
- Support 10,000+ YAML configs with tenant isolation
- 99.9% config availability

**Dependencies:**
- **Proposal Generator** (consumes proposal_signed event to trigger YAML config generation)
- **PRD Builder** (provides PRD data for config population)
- Agent Orchestration Service (loads YAML configs for chatbot runtime)
- Voice Agent Service (loads YAML configs for voicebot runtime)
- Configuration Management Service (stores and distributes configs)
- GitHub API (issue creation, status tracking)

**Technical Architecture by Product Type:**

1. **Chatbot Products** (LangGraph-based):
   - **Runtime Service**: Agent Orchestration Service
   - **Framework**: LangGraph two-node workflow (agent node + tools node)
   - **Architecture Reference**: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/customer-support/customer-support/
   - **YAML Config Features**:
     - StateGraph implementation with checkpointing
     - `external_integrations` field (Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.)
     - Dynamic tool loading from YAML
     - PostgreSQL-backed state persistence
   - **Config Consumption**: Agent Orchestration Service reads chatbot YAML configs
   - **Documentation**: See MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE_PART3.md (Agent Orchestration Service)

2. **Voicebot Products** (LiveKit-based):
   - **Runtime Service**: Voice Agent Service
   - **Framework**: LiveKit Agents (Python SDK) with VoicePipelineAgent
   - **Architecture Components**:
     - STT Pipeline: Deepgram Nova-3 streaming transcription
     - LLM Integration: Same as chatbot but optimized for voice latency
     - TTS Pipeline: ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 with dual streaming
     - SIP Integration: Twilio (primary), Telnyx (failover)
   - **YAML Config Features**:
     - NO `external_integrations` field (voice-only channel)
     - SIP endpoint configured separately via SIP trunk provisioning
     - Voice-specific config: STT/TTS providers, voice_id, turn detection
     - Tool execution via LiveKit agent callbacks
   - **Config Consumption**: Voice Agent Service reads voicebot YAML configs
   - **Documentation**: See MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE_PART3.md (Voice Agent Service)

3. **Hybrid Deployments**:
   - Requires **separate YAML configs** for chatbot and voicebot
   - PRD includes distinct sprint roadmaps per product type
   - Shared PRD objectives but product-specific implementations
   - Cross-product communication via `cross_product_events` Kafka topic

**Data Storage:**
- PostgreSQL: Config metadata, versions, GitHub issue mapping, validation logs
- S3: YAML config files, config snapshots
- Git Repository: Version-controlled config storage
- Redis: Hot-reload notification queue

#### Features

**Must-Have:**
1. âœ… YAML config generation from PRD
2. âœ… Webchat UI for config refinement
3. âœ… Canvas editor for manual YAML editing
4. âœ… GitHub issue auto-creation for missing dependencies
5. âœ… Tool/integration status tracking with auto-attachment
6. âœ… JSON Schema validation
7. âœ… Config versioning with rollback
8. âœ… Hot-reload via Kafka events

**Nice-to-Have:**
9. ðŸ”„ AI-powered config optimization suggestions
10. ðŸ”„ Config diff analyzer (compare configs across clients)
11. ðŸ”„ Automated regression testing for config changes
12. ðŸ”„ Config template marketplace

**Feature Interactions:**
- PRD approval â†’ Auto-generates YAML config
- GitHub issue closed (tool implemented) â†’ Auto-updates config
- Config validation failure â†’ Rollback to previous version

  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:00:05Z"
}

**Note on Hot-Reload Implementation:**
The hot-reload mechanism uses version pinning to ensure in-progress conversations continue with their original config version while new conversations use the updated config. This prevents breaking changes mid-conversation. Implementation details including version pinning logic, conversation state tracking, and config caching strategy are documented in **MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE_PART3.md** (Agent Orchestration Service, lines 410-583).

## 16. LLM Gateway Service

#### Objectives
- **Primary Purpose**: Centralized LLM inference with model routing, semantic caching, token monitoring, and cost optimization across all AI-powered services
- **Business Value**: Reduces LLM costs by 40-60% through caching and smart routing, provides unified interface for multi-provider support, enables real-time cost tracking
- **Scope Boundaries**:
  - **Does**: Route requests to optimal models, cache semantically similar prompts, track token usage, provide fallback mechanisms, support streaming responses
  - **Does Not**: Train models, fine-tune models, manage model deployment infrastructure

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Multi-provider support (OpenAI GPT-4/3.5, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI)
2. Semantic caching with similarity threshold (e.g., 95% similar â†’ cache hit)
3. Model routing based on complexity, cost, latency requirements
4. Token usage tracking per tenant, per service, per model
5. Streaming response support for real-time conversations
6. Fallback routing when primary model unavailable
7. Rate limiting per provider API limits
8. Cost budgeting and alerting

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Inference latency: <500ms P95 (excluding model processing time)
- Cache hit rate: >40% (target 60%)
- Support 10,000+ requests/second
- 99.99% uptime (critical for all AI workflows)
- Cost reduction: 40-60% vs. direct API calls

**Dependencies:**
- Agent Orchestration Service (primary consumer)
- Voice Agent Service (real-time inference)
- PRD Builder (document generation)
- Demo Generator (content creation)
- Redis (semantic cache storage)
- Analytics Service (cost tracking)

**Data Storage:**
- Redis: Semantic cache (prompt embeddings + responses), rate limiting counters

- TimescaleDB: Time-series cost analytics, usage trends

#### Features

**Must-Have:**
1. âœ… Multi-provider routing (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
2. âœ… Semantic caching with embedding-based similarity
3. âœ… Token usage tracking (per tenant, per service, per model)

5. âœ… Automatic fallback routing on provider failures
6. âœ… Cost budgeting with alerts (daily/monthly limits)
7. âœ… Model selection API (cheap, balanced, premium)
8. âœ… Real-time cost dashboard

**Nice-to-Have:**
9. ðŸ”„ Fine-tuned model deployment

#### Model Routing Logic

**Model Selection Strategy:**
```
User requests "cheap":
  â†’ Route to gpt-3.5-turbo (OpenAI) or Claude Instant (Anthropic)
  â†’ Fallback: Gemini Pro (Google)

User requests "balanced":
  â†’ Route to gpt-4-turbo (OpenAI) or Claude Sonnet (Anthropic)
  â†’ Fallback: gpt-3.5-turbo

User requests "premium":
  â†’ Route to gpt-4 (OpenAI) or Claude Opus (Anthropic)
  â†’ Fallback: gpt-4-turbo
```

**Semantic Caching:**
```
1. Generate embedding for incoming prompt
2. Search Redis for similar embeddings (cosine similarity > 0.95)
3. If cache hit:
   a. Return cached response
   b. Log cache hit, save cost
   c. Increment cache_hit_rate metric
4. If cache miss:
   a. Call LLM provider
   b. Store embedding + response in Redis (TTL: 24 hours)
   c. Return response
```
