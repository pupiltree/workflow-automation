# Epic: workflow-automation

## Overview

Implementation of a comprehensive microservices-based workflow automation platform that transforms manual sales processes into AI-powered, scalable workflows. The platform leverages proven LangGraph patterns, LiveKit voice integration, and YAML-driven configuration to enable rapid client onboarding with minimal human intervention.

**Core Technical Approach**: Build on existing proven architecture patterns from kishna_diagnostics and centurypropertytax, extending the reliable 2-node LangGraph workflow model across 12 specialized microservices with unified YAML configuration management.

## Architecture Decisions

### **Proven Foundation Strategy**
- **Extend Existing Patterns**: Leverage proven 2-node LangGraph architecture from existing codebase
- **Microservices Evolution**: Transform monolithic patterns into 12 specialized, independently scalable services
- **Configuration-Driven Design**: YAML configs define behavior, eliminating code changes for client customization

### **Technology Stack Ratification**
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI for all microservices (consistency with existing codebase)
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph 2-node pattern (Agent + Tools) proven in production
- **Voice Integration**: LiveKit Agents framework (extends existing voice capabilities)
- **Data Layer**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Pinecone (vector) + Redis (caching)
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with WebSocket support for real-time features

### **Integration Philosophy**
- **API-First Design**: All services expose REST APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async processing via message queues for workflow coordination
- **Model Context Protocol**: Standardized tool and resource access patterns
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Unified backend supporting voice, chat, webhooks, and integrations

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Unified Dashboard**: Single-page React app for all user roles with role-based views
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration for live PRD editing and proposal collaboration
- **Canvas Integration**: Rich editing interface for document collaboration with manual + AI assistance
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS for cross-device compatibility

### Backend Services Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Unified entry point with authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- **Core Microservices**: 12 domain-specific services with independent scaling
- **Shared Libraries**: Common authentication, logging, and data access patterns
- **Message Bus**: RabbitMQ for async workflow coordination between services

### Infrastructure Strategy
- **Containerization**: Docker containers with multi-stage builds for efficiency
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for service management and auto-scaling
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + custom health check endpoints

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase-Based Delivery**
1. **Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)**: Core infrastructure + Research Engine + Demo Generator
2. **Automation Phase (Months 4-6)**: Contract automation + PRD Builder + basic Automation Engine
3. **Scale Phase (Months 7-9)**: Full YAML orchestration + Voice integration + Multi-client deployment
4. **Enterprise Phase (Months 10-12)**: Advanced monitoring + Customer success + Performance optimization

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Proven Patterns First**: Start with known working architecture patterns
- **Incremental Complexity**: Add AI features after core infrastructure is stable
- **Parallel Development**: Independent microservices enable team parallelization
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated testing at service and integration levels

### **Development Approach**
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage for critical business logic
- **Documentation-First**: API specifications before implementation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Observability built into each service from day one
