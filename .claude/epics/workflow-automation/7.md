# Task: Automation Engine Core

## Overview
Implement the YAML-driven automation engine that orchestrates client-specific chatbots and voicebots based on configuration files generated from PRDs.

## Requirements
- YAML schema definition and validation system
- LangGraph workflow template system with 2-node pattern
- Dynamic tool and integration mapping
- GitHub integration for automated issue creation
- Multi-client bot orchestration and isolation
- Configuration hot-swapping without downtime

## Implementation Details
- **YAML Engine**: Configuration parser with validation and schema enforcement
- **LangGraph Templates**: Reusable 2-node (Agent + Tools) workflow patterns
- **Tool Registry**: Dynamic loading of tools based on YAML configuration
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated issue creation for missing tools/integrations
- **Bot Orchestration**: Multi-tenant system for running client-specific bots
- **Hot Reload**: Configuration updates without service restart

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parse and validate YAML configurations
- [ ] Deploy client-specific bots from YAML configs
- [ ] Support 100+ concurrent client configurations
- [ ] Create GitHub issues for missing tools automatically
- [ ] Enable configuration updates without downtime
- [ ] Provide configuration validation with detailed error messages
- [ ] Support A/B testing through configuration variants

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure foundation for container orchestration
- PRD builder for configuration generation
- GitHub API access for issue creation

## Technical Notes
- Extend proven LangGraph patterns from kishna_diagnostics
- Implement robust error handling for configuration failures
- Use container-based isolation for client bot instances
