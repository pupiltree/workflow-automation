# Task: Infrastructure Foundation

## Overview
Set up core platform infrastructure, shared libraries, and deployment pipeline that serves as the foundation for all microservices in the workflow automation platform.

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling capabilities
- API Gateway with authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- Shared data models and database schemas
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Implementation Details
- **Kubernetes Setup**: Production-ready cluster with namespaces for dev/staging/prod
- **API Gateway**: Kong or Istio Gateway with JWT authentication
- **Database Infrastructure**: Multi-tenant PostgreSQL with Supabase
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async workflow coordination
- **Shared Libraries**: Common authentication, logging, and data access patterns
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and security scanning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster deployed with auto-scaling
- [ ] API Gateway routes traffic with <50ms overhead
- [ ] Database schemas support multi-tenancy
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys to all environments
- [ ] Service mesh enables secure inter-service communication
- [ ] Monitoring stack captures metrics and logs
- [ ] Load testing validates 10K concurrent connections

## Dependencies
- DevOps team for cluster setup
- Security team for compliance review

## Technical Notes
- Use proven patterns from kishna_diagnostics codebase
- Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Ensure SOC 2 compliance from day one
