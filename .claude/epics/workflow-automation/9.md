# Task: Integration Management

## Overview
Build comprehensive integration management system that connects with external platforms (CRMs, messaging, social media) and manages multi-channel communication workflows.

## Requirements
- Multi-channel messaging support (WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS, email)
- CRM integration connectors (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive)
- Webhook management and event routing system
- Integration health monitoring and failure recovery
- OAuth and API key management for external services
- Message queue handling for high-volume communications

## Implementation Details
- **Message Routing**: Unified messaging interface with channel-specific adapters
- **CRM Connectors**: Standardized connectors with common data models
- **Webhook System**: Reliable webhook handling with retry logic
- **Health Monitoring**: Integration status tracking with automated alerts
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting per integration provider

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support 5+ messaging channels with unified interface
- [ ] Integrate with 3+ major CRM systems
- [ ] Handle 10,000+ messages per hour across all channels
- [ ] Provide real-time integration health monitoring
- [ ] Implement automatic retry logic for failed operations
- [ ] Secure credential storage with encryption at rest
- [ ] Enable webhook routing with <100ms processing time

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure foundation for secure service communication
- Automation engine for configuration-driven integrations
- External API access and approval from integration providers

## Technical Notes
- Use adapter pattern for consistent integration interfaces
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API failures
- Ensure message delivery guarantees with persistent queues
