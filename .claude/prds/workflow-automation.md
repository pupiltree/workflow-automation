# PRD: workflow-automation

## Executive Summary

The Workflow Automation Platform is a comprehensive microservices-based solution that automates the entire client acquisition and onboarding pipeline. The platform leverages AI chatbots, voicebots, and intelligent automation to transform manual sales processes into scalable, data-driven workflows that operate with minimal human intervention while maintaining personalization and quality.

**Value Proposition**: Reduce client onboarding time from weeks to days, increase conversion rates by 40%+, and scale sales operations without proportional headcount growth.

## Problem Statement
