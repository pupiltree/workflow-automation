      <change version="2.3">MAJOR REVISION - Research-aligned MVP scope: Redefined MVP to Sprint 1-6 foundation (Services 0, 7, 8 + libraries @workflow/llm-sdk, @workflow/config-sdk); Moved Services 2, 6, 9, 15, 20 AND Service 17 to post-MVP phases per RESEARCH.md Sprint 1-18 guidance; Service 17 RAG is Sprint 7-8 (basic) and Sprint 11-12 (GraphRAG); Clarified Service 11 (basic monitoring MVP, advanced features Sprint 15-16), Service 20 (basic email Sprint 13-14, hyperpersonalization Sprint 19+); Added Helicone integration Sprint 3-4, realistic team scaling (2→4→6→8 devs), and phased parallel workstream timing</change>
      <change version="2.2">Final architecture validation corrections: Fixed Service 11 (added incident detection/RCA), Service 20 (full hyperpersonalization capabilities), Service 2 (removed incorrect scope limitation); Enhanced mvp_008 clarity; Added Service 11 MVP scope flexibility note; Added dependency warning for Services 1,3 coordination with Service 2</change>
      <change version="2.1">Corrected MVP definition based on architecture validation: Added Services 2, 15, 20 to MVP critical path; Fixed capability descriptions (removed "intelligent" language, clarified webhook-driven workflows); Defined Service 11 scope; Updated parallel workstreams accordingly</change>
      <change version="2.0">Enabled parallel development from Sprint 1 with independent workstreams to maximize Claude Code effectiveness and deliver incremental automation value</change>

  </metadata>

  <objective>
    Generate a comprehensive, detailed sprint-by-sprint implementation plan for building an AI-powered B2B SaaS workflow automation platform following agile methodology and microservices architecture best practices. The plan must account for realistic developer productivity metrics when using Claude Code and enable PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT from Sprint 1, where core team builds MVP while additional developers work independently on non-MVP services. This ensures continuous automation value delivery (X% automation) even if MVP timeline extends, maximizing Claude Code's effectiveness through independent, well-scoped workstreams.
