## Executive Summary

### Platform Vision

This platform automates the complete B2B SaaS client lifecycle from initial research through production monitoring and customer success, with the goal of achieving **95% automation** within 8 months (32 weeks).

### Architecture Overview

- **17 Active Microservices** (optimized from 22 through consolidation)
- **2 Supporting Libraries** (@workflow/llm-sdk, @workflow/config-sdk)
- **18 Kafka Topics** for event-driven coordination
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with PostgreSQL Row-Level Security
- **Cloud-native deployment** on Kubernetes with service mesh

### Release Milestones

| Milestone | Week | Services | Automation | Users |
|-----------|------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Alpha** | 4 | 5 | 30% | Internal + 5-10 design partners |
| **Beta (MVP)** | 16 | 11 | 60% | 50-100 pilot customers |
| **Prod v1.0** | 24 | 14 | 80% | General availability |
| **Prod v2.0** | 32 | 17 | 95% | Full platform launch |

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous Kafka-based coordination eliminates tight coupling
2. **Library Conversion**: Services 10, 16 converted to libraries, reducing latency by 400-900ms
3. **Service Consolidation**: 22 → 17 services, eliminating distributed monolith anti-patterns
4. **Multi-Tenancy**: Row-Level Security + namespace isolation ensures zero data leakage
5. **Hot-Reload**: Config updates propagate without service restarts (<60s)

- **Time-Series**: TimescaleDB 2.13+ (analytics, metrics)
- **Cache**: Redis 7.2+ (sessions, hot configs)
- **Event Store**: ClickHouse 23.x (traces, events)

#### AI/LLM Stack
- **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph (chatbots), LiveKit Agents (voice)
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Anthropic (Claude Opus/Sonnet)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- **Voice STT**: Deepgram Nova-3
- **Voice TTS**: ElevenLabs Flash v2.5, OpenAI TTS

#### Observability

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Isolation Strategy**:
1. **Database Level**: PostgreSQL RLS on all tables filtering by `organization_id`
2. **Vector DB**: Qdrant namespaces per tenant (`tenant_{org_id}`)
3. **Graph DB**: Neo4j namespace isolation
4. **Cache**: Redis key prefixes per tenant
5. **S3 Configs**: `/configs/{organization_id}/{config_id}.json`
6. **Kafka Events**: All events include `organization_id` field

**Agent Access Pattern**:
- Human agents can access all organizations (`user_type='agent'` bypasses RLS)
- Permission checks at Kong API Gateway level
- No circular dependencies in auth flow

**Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- Example: Semantic caching to reduce LLM latency

**Transfer**: Shift risk to third party
- Example: Use Stripe for payment processing instead of building custom

**Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor
- Example: External API rate limits are accepted, monitor and implement backoff

### Risk Monitoring

- **Weekly risk review** in sprint planning
- **Risk register** maintained in Notion or Linear
- **Escalation path**: Team → Scrum Master → Product Manager → CTO
