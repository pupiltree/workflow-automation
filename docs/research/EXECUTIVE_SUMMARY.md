## Critical Findings at a Glance

### AI Productivity Reality Check

**The Good News:**
- **Boilerplate/Repetitive:** 2-4x faster (100-300% improvement)

## Technology Stack Finalized

### Service Mesh: Linkerd (Not Istio)
**Why:** 163ms faster, 90% less resource usage, simpler deployment

### API Gateway: Kong
**Why:** Pluggable architecture, excellent microservices support (as planned)

### Multi-Tenancy: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
**Why:** Shared schema + tenant_id + RLS = balance of simplicity and isolation

### CI/CD: GitOps with Argo CD
**Why:** Git as source of truth, automated deployment, drift detection

### Secrets: External Secrets Operator + AWS Secrets Manager
**Why:** Kubernetes-native, automatic rotation, GitOps compatible

### Event Bus: Apache Kafka
**Why:** Proven at scale, event sourcing support (as planned)

---

## Sprint Planning Recommendations

### Sprints 1-8 (Weeks 1-8): 1-Week Sprints
- High uncertainty in architecture
- Rapid validation with AI assistance
- Frequent course corrections

### Sprints 9-20 (Weeks 9-40): 2-Week Sprints
- Architecture validated
- Team velocity established
- Focus on feature delivery

### Velocity Estimation
- **Sprint 1:** 30% of perceived capacity (conservative)
- **Sprints 2-3:** Track and measure actuals
- **Sprint 3+:** Use 3-sprint average as baseline
- **AI Multiplier:**
  - Junior-heavy team: 1.3-1.4x baseline
  - Senior-heavy team: 1.1-1.2x baseline
  - Mixed team: 1.15-1.25x baseline

## Key Architecture Patterns

### 1. Database Per Service + Multi-Tenancy
```
Each Microservice:
├── Own PostgreSQL database
└── Shared schema with tenant_id column
    └── Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
```

**Critical:** NEVER share database across microservices

### 2. Event-Driven with Kafka
```
Service A → Kafka Topic → Service B
          (event)
```

**Naming:** `{service}_{entity}_{event}` (e.g., `prd_builder.prd.created`)
**Always Include:** tenant_id, correlation_id, timestamp, schema_version

### 3. API Gateway Pattern
```
Client → Kong Gateway → Microservices
         (auth, rate limiting, routing)
```

### 4. Service Mesh (Linkerd)
```
Pod A ↔ Linkerd Proxy ↔ Linkerd Proxy ↔ Pod B
        (mTLS, observability, retries)
```

**Benefits:** Automatic mTLS, 5-10% overhead vs 40-400% for Istio

### 5. GitOps Deployment
```
Git Repo → Argo CD → Kubernetes Cluster
(manifests) (sync)   (deployed services)
```

**Benefits:** Declarative, auditable, automated drift correction

## Security Best Practices (2025)

### Secrets Management
- **Never:** Store secrets in code, environment variables, or Git
- **Always:** Use External Secrets Operator + AWS Secrets Manager
- **Prefer:** Short-lived credentials (15-60 minutes) via IAM roles
- **Rotate:** Automatically every 30-90 days

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
```sql
-- Every table must have tenant_id
CREATE TABLE users (
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  ...
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);
```

**Test:** Every API endpoint must have automated test verifying tenant isolation

### Kubernetes Security
- Network policies: Default deny, explicit allow
- RBAC: Principle of least privilege
- Pod Security Standards: Restricted for production
- Image scanning: Trivy or Docker Scout in CI pipeline
- No root containers: Always specify non-root user

---

## Container Build Optimization

### Multi-Stage Builds (Mandatory)
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime stage
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
USER node
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

**Result:** 60-80% smaller images, faster deployments

### Best Practices
- Use Alpine base images (5MB vs 100+MB)
- Cache layers effectively (dependencies before code)
- Scan images with Trivy before push
- Never use `latest` tag in production
- Implement health checks

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Pattern

```
Code Commit
    ↓
CI Pipeline (Per Microservice)
├── Unit Tests
├── Code Quality (SonarQube)
├── Security Scan (Trivy)
├── Docker Build (multi-stage)
├── Image Scan
└── Push to Registry (tagged with commit SHA)
    ↓
CD Pipeline (GitOps)
├── Update K8s manifests in GitOps repo
├── Argo CD detects change
├── Deploy to dev → integration tests
├── Deploy to staging (canary)
├── Production (approval gate)
└── Progressive rollout (10%→50%→100%)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: AI Over-Reliance
**Symptom:** High velocity but increasing bugs
**Mitigation:** Track defect density per sprint
**Action:** Reduce AI usage if quality degrades

### Risk 2: Multi-Tenant Data Leakage
**Symptom:** Data visible across tenants
**Mitigation:** Automated tests for every endpoint
**Action:** Mandatory RLS review in code review

### Risk 3: Kafka Schema Evolution
**Symptom:** Breaking changes cause failures
**Mitigation:** Schema registry with compatibility checks
**Action:** Enforce backward compatibility

### Risk 4: Secret Management Complexity
**Symptom:** Secrets in code/env files
**Mitigation:** Pre-commit hooks to detect secrets
**Action:** Mandatory External Secrets Operator
