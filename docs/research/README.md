## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. ✅ Review and validate research with stakeholders
2. ⬜ Update architecture documentation with finalized tech stack
3. ⬜ Create AI usage guidelines document for dev team
4. ⬜ Set up sprint planning with 1-week duration for Sprints 1-8
5. ⬜ Establish success metrics dashboard

### Before Sprint 1 Starts
1. ⬜ Development environment configured with approved tools
2. ⬜ GitHub/GitLab repository structure created
3. ⬜ CI/CD pipeline template ready
4. ⬜ Multi-tenancy database schema designed

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves for Production
- ✅ Row-level security on EVERY table with `tenant_id`
- ✅ Automated tests for tenant isolation on EVERY API endpoint
- ✅ Image scanning in CI pipeline (Trivy)
- ✅ Secret management via External Secrets Operator (no secrets in Git)
- ✅ Network policies (default deny, explicit allow)
- ✅ Health checks (liveness + readiness) on every service
- ✅ Observability (metrics, logs, traces) on every service

### Performance Targets
- API latency P95 < 200ms
- Voice agent latency < 500ms
- Service mesh overhead < 10ms
- Database query P95 < 100ms
- Event processing latency < 1s

### Cost Targets
- LLM token usage optimized with semantic caching
- Infrastructure cost per tenant tracked
- Service mesh resource overhead minimized (Linkerd choice)
- Auto-scaling configured (HPA + cluster autoscaling)
