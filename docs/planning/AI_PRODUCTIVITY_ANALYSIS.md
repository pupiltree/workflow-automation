---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Productivity Gains Don't Materialize
**Probability**: MEDIUM (30% chance based on METR study)

**Mitigation**:
- Track metrics rigorously from Sprint 1
- If velocity <5% improvement by Sprint 6, reassess tool usage
- Fallback: Revert to 18-month timeline

**Contingency**: Original sprint plan is still valid if AI tools underperform

---

### Risk 2: Over-Reliance on AI-Generated Code (Quality Issues)
**Probability**: MEDIUM (25% chance)

**Mitigation**:
- **Mandatory human review** of all AI-generated code
- **Security scanning** (Trivy, Snyk) catches vulnerable AI suggestions
- **Test coverage requirements** (>80%) prevent untested AI code from merging
- **Pair programming** on complex tasks (one human, one AI)

**Contingency**: Increase code review rigor, add dedicated security review sprint

---

### Risk 3: Learning Curve Extends Beyond 11 Weeks
**Probability**: LOW (15% chance, team is experienced)

**Mitigation**:
- Front-load training (pre-Sprint 1 workshop)
- Assign "AI champion" per team to share best practices
- Weekly knowledge sharing (15-min demos of effective AI usage)

**Contingency**: Extend Phase 1 by 1 sprint if needed

---

### Risk 4: AI Tool Costs Increase (Pricing Changes)
**Probability**: LOW (10% chance in 17 months)

**Mitigation**:
- Lock in annual contracts where possible
- Monitor usage to avoid overage charges
- Budget 20% buffer for price increases

**Contingency**: Switch to open-source alternatives (e.g., local LLM with Ollama)

---

## üìã Recommendations for Implementation

### 1. **Adopt Conservative Timeline** (16-17 months)
- Use **16-17 month estimate** for planning and commitments
- Internal target: 15 months (create 1-2 month buffer)
- **Rationale**: Reduces risk of over-promising based on optimistic AI gains

### 2. **Maintain Original Team Size**
- Keep 8-12 person team as planned
- Use AI productivity for **speed, not cost-cutting**
- **Rationale**: Higher quality, lower risk, more time for polish

### 3. **Implement Rigorous Tracking from Day 1**
- Track metrics: time-to-first-PR, PRs/week, review latency, sprint velocity
- Monthly review: Compare actual vs. predicted AI gains
- **Decision Point**: Sprint 6 (end of learning curve) - Go/No-Go on accelerated timeline

### 4. **Prioritize High-Leverage Tasks in Early Sprints**
- Front-load infrastructure, schemas, boilerplate (high AI leverage)
- Back-load complex AI architecture work (low AI leverage)
- **Rationale**: Maximize early wins, build confidence in AI tools

### 5. **Mandatory Human Oversight**
- All AI-generated code must be reviewed by human engineer
- Security-critical code (RLS policies, auth) requires **2 human reviews**
- **Rationale**: Mitigates quality and security risks from over-reliance on AI
