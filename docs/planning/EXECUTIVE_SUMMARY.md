## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Container Orchestration** | Kubernetes (EKS) | Industry standard, portable |
| **API Gateway** | Kong | Kubernetes-native, rich plugins |
| **Event Bus** | Apache Kafka | Event streaming with replay |
| **Primary DB** | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | RLS for multi-tenancy |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant | High-performance embeddings |
| **Cache** | Redis | Session management, queues |
| **Chatbot** | LangGraph | Stateful agents, checkpointing |
| **Voicebot** | LiveKit | Real-time voice <500ms |
| **LLM Primary** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Cost-effective, fast |
| **Voice STT** | Deepgram Nova-3 | Best accuracy |
| **Voice TTS** | ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 | Natural, fast |
| **Observability** | Prometheus + Grafana | Kubernetes-native |

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Multi-Tenancy**:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL for data isolation
- Namespace-based isolation in Qdrant/Neo4j
- `tenant_id` filtering in every query

**Event-Driven Architecture**:
- 18 Kafka topics for service orchestration
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Idempotent event handlers for reliability

**JSON Configuration**:
- S3 storage with versioning
- Redis caching for hot-reload (<50ms config changes)
- JSON Schema validation for config safety

**Library-Based Communication** (eliminates service hops):
- `@workflow/llm-sdk`: Direct LLM access (saves 200-500ms per call)
- `@workflow/config-sdk`: Direct S3 access (saves 50-100ms per fetch)

## 🚀 Vision Statement

> "By Month 18, we will have built a platform that automates 95% of the B2B SaaS client lifecycle—from initial research through customer success—enabling our customers to scale revenue without proportionally scaling human headcount. Our AI-powered chatbots and voicebots will handle thousands of concurrent conversations with <500ms latency, while our Agent Copilot will make human agents 10x more productive. We will achieve this through rigorous engineering discipline, event-driven microservices architecture, and relentless focus on multi-tenant security and performance."
