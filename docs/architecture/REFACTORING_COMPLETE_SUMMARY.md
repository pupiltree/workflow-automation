## üí° Implementation Notes

### Best Practices Followed
1. **Systematic Approach**: Completed PART1 entirely before moving to PART2/PART3
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every change includes rationale and impact
3. **Preservation of Functionality**: All features retained, just reorganized
4. **Clear Migration Paths**: Consolidation notes explain where functionality moved
5. **Validation**: SERVICE_INDEX.md serves as single source of truth

### Lessons Learned
1. **Large File Handling**: Used sub-agents effectively for 5,000+ line files
2. **Context Management**: Broke work into phases to preserve token budget
3. **Progress Tracking**: Created multiple documentation artifacts for transparency
4. **Verification**: Cross-checked consolidations against SERVICE_INDEX.md

### Risks Mitigated
1. **Data Loss**: All eliminated service sections replaced with consolidation notes
2. **Broken References**: SERVICE_INDEX.md provides redirection guide
3. **Regression**: Functional requirements preserved in merged services
4. **Confusion**: Clear before/after documentation for each change
