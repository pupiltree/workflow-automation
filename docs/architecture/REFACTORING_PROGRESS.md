## ⏳ REMAINING WORK (70%)

### Phase 2: PART1 Consolidations (50% Remaining)

#### Task 1: Merge Services 3, 4, 5 → Service 3 (CRITICAL)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Services to Consolidate**:
- Service 3: NDA Generator Service
- Service 4: Pricing Model Generator Service
- Service 5: Proposal Generator Service

**New Service**: Service 3: Sales Document Generator Service

**Actions Required**:
1. Find Service 3, 4, 5 section headers in MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Rename Service 3 from "NDA Generator Service" to "Sales Document Generator Service"
3. Add consolidation note at start:
   ```markdown
   **Service Consolidation**: Service 3 is a unified Sales Document Generator that combines NDA generation (formerly Service 3), pricing model generation (formerly Service 4), and proposal generation (formerly Service 5). This consolidation eliminates the distributed monolith anti-pattern where three tightly-coupled services formed a sequential pipeline with shared templates and e-signature integration.
   ```
4. Merge content from Services 4 and 5 into Service 3:
   - **API Endpoints**: Combine all endpoints (likely 15-20 total)
   - **Database Schema**: Merge tables: `ndas`, `pricing_models`, `proposals`, `templates`, `approval_workflows`, `e_signatures`
   - **Kafka Events**: Change from individual topics (`nda_events`, `pricing_events`, `proposal_events`) to unified `sales_doc_events`
   - **E-signature Integration**: Single DocuSign/HelloSign integration (not duplicated)
   - **Template Management**: Unified template system for all document types
5. Remove standalone Service 4 and Service 5 sections entirely
6. Add reference notes where Services 4 and 5 were:
   ```markdown
   **Service 4 has been consolidated into Service 3 (Sales Document Generator)** - See Service 3 above for complete specification.
   ```

**Expected Benefits**:
- Eliminates distributed monolith anti-pattern
- Reduces 3-hop distributed transaction to single-service operation
- 150-300ms latency improvement
- Single e-signature integration point
- Unified template management

#### Task 2: Remove Service 18 Section
**Estimated Effort**: 15 minutes

Service 18 (Outbound Communication) has been moved to PART3 and merged with Service 20.

**Actions**:
1. Find "Service 18: Outbound Communication Service" section
2. Replace entire section with consolidation note:
   ```markdown
   ### Service 18: Outbound Communication Service → CONSOLIDATED

   **Service 18 has been consolidated into Service 20 (Communication & Hyperpersonalization Engine)** - See MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE_PART3.md Service 20 for complete specification.

   **Rationale**: Eliminated duplicate email/SMS sending logic and template management by merging outbound communication into the hyperpersonalization engine.
   ```

#### Task 3: Update Architecture Diagram
**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes

**Location**: Around lines 146-197 in MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Changes**:
- Update service count: "22 specialized microservices" → "15 specialized microservices"
- Remove service boxes for: 0.5, 4, 5, 10, 16, 18, 19
- Add library notes: @workflow/llm-sdk, @workflow/config-sdk
- Update Kafka topics: 19 → 17 topics
- Update topic names: Show `sales_doc_events`, `communication_events` (consolidated topics)

#### Task 4: Update Cross-References Throughout PART1
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

**Search and Replace Patterns**:
- `Service 0.5` → `Service 0 (Organization & Identity Management)`
- `Human Agent Management Service` → `Organization & Identity Management Service (includes agent management)`
- `Service 4` → `Service 3 (Sales Document Generator)`
- `Pricing Model Generator Service` → `Sales Document Generator Service (pricing module)`
- `Service 5` → `Service 3 (Sales Document Generator)`
- `Proposal Generator Service` → `Sales Document Generator Service (proposal module)`
- `Service 18` → `Service 20 (see MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE_PART3.md)`
- `Outbound Communication Service` → `Communication & Hyperpersonalization Engine (see PART3)`

**Verification**:
Run after changes:
```bash
grep -i "service 0\.5" docs/architecture/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md
grep -i "service 4[^0-9]" docs/architecture/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md
grep -i "service 5[^0-9]" docs/architecture/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md
grep -i "service 18" docs/architecture/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md
```
All should return zero results (or only consolidation notes).
