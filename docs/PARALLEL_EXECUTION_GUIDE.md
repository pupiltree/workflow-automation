# Parallel Execution Guide
## MVP Development with 2-Developer Core Team

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**For**: Core MVP Team (You + 1 Developer)
**Duration**: Sprints 1-20 (40 weeks / ~10 months)

---

## Executive Summary

### Team Structure

**Core MVP Team (Sprints 1-20)**:
- **Developer 1 (You)**: Backend-heavy, Infrastructure, Services 0, 6, 7, 11
- **Developer 2**: AI/ML-heavy, LangGraph, LiveKit, Services 8, 9, 17

**Extended Teams (Sprints 21-32)** - Start AFTER MVP Launch:
- **Sales Pipeline Team (2 devs)**: Services 1, 2, 3, 22 (can start Sprint 21)
- **Customer Operations Team (2 devs)**: Services 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21 (can start Sprint 21)

### Critical Rule: NO Post-MVP Work Until Sprint 20

**Why Sequential for MVP?**
1. **Dependency Chain**: Services 8/9 depend on 7, which depends on 6, which depends on 0
2. **Architecture Foundation**: Core services define patterns that post-MVP services follow
3. **Configuration System**: Services 1-3, 12-15, 20-22 all need the config system from Service 7
4. **Team Learning**: Core team must establish patterns before extended teams join

---

## Daily Coordination Rituals

### Daily Standup (15 minutes, every day)

**Format**:
1. What I did yesterday
2. What I'm doing today
3. Any blockers

**Example**:
- Developer 1: "Yesterday I implemented RLS policies. Today I'm writing tests. No blockers."
- Developer 2: "Yesterday I set up Redis. Today I'm implementing JWT tokens. Blocked on Supabase credentials from Dev1."

### Code Review Windows (3 times per day)

**Morning (10am)**: Review PRs from previous day
**Afternoon (3pm)**: Review PRs from morning work
**End of day (5pm)**: Review PRs from afternoon work

**Rule**: No PR sits unreviewed for >4 hours

### Integration Checkpoints (Fridays)

**Friday afternoon** (3-5pm):
- Demo what you built this week
- Integration testing together
- Plan next week's work

---

## Communication Protocols

### When to Pair vs. When to Work Independently

**MUST Pair (Schedule 2-3 hour blocks)**:
- LangGraph integration (Sprint 10 Week 19 Day 5, Week 20 Day 3)
- LiveKit integration (Sprint 13 Week 25 Day 4, Week 26 Day 3)
- Security reviews (Sprint 12 Week 23 Day 4, Week 24 Day 4)
- Critical architecture decisions
- Complex debugging sessions

**Can Work Independently**:
- Database schema creation
- API endpoint implementation
- Test writing
- Documentation
- UI component development

**Should Sync (30-min video calls)**:
- API contract design (input/output formats)
- Database schema design
- Kafka event schema design
- UI/UX decisions

### Slack Communication Guidelines

**Use Threads**:
- Keep related discussions in threads
- Makes it easy to find context later

**Use @mentions**:
- `@dev2` when you need immediate response
- `@channel` only for critical blockers

**Share Screenshots/Code**:
- Use code blocks for code sharing
- Use screenshots for UI/UX discussions

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Sprints: 10, 13 (LangGraph, LiveKit)

**Before Sprint Starts**:
- Dev2 watches tutorials (LangGraph: 4 hours, LiveKit: 4 hours)
- Dev2 builds "Hello World" example (LangGraph: 2 hours, LiveKit: 2 hours)

**During Sprint**:
- Daily pairing sessions (minimum 1 hour)
- Keep scope flexible (defer advanced features if needed)
- Have backup plan (alternative framework if completely blocked)

**After Sprint**:
- Write knowledge-sharing doc (lessons learned)
- Create reusable templates for future services

### Security-Critical Sprints: 1, 12, 17

**Before Sprint Starts**:
- Review OWASP Top 10
- Review RLS policy best practices
- Review PII encryption requirements

**During Sprint**:
- Daily security standup (15 min)
- External security review (if budget allows)
- Penetration testing

**After Sprint**:
- Security audit report
- Remediation plan for any vulnerabilities

## Final Notes

### Key Success Factors

1. **Communicate Early and Often**: Don't wait until end of day to share blockers
2. **Pair on Complex Work**: LangGraph, LiveKit, security reviews require pairing
3. **Respect the Critical Path**: Some tasks MUST be sequential (databases before APIs)
4. **Test Continuously**: Don't wait until end of sprint to test integration
5. **Document as You Go**: Write docs while context is fresh, not at the end

### When Things Go Wrong

**If you're falling behind schedule**:
- Reduce scope (defer non-critical features)
- Extend sprint by 1-2 days (buffer)
- Call for help (extended team can start early if needed)

**If you're blocked on external dependencies**:
- Work on other tasks in parallel
- Communicate delay to stakeholders immediately
- Have backup plan (alternative approach)

**If code quality is slipping**:
- Slow down (quality over velocity)
- Increase code review rigor
- Add more tests before moving forward

---

**Good luck with your MVP development! 🚀**

**Remember**: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourselves, communicate constantly, and celebrate small wins along the way.
