- [ ] If client approves: Deploy to production
- [ ] If client rejects: Discard changes
- [ ] One-click rollback if production issues occur (<5 minutes)
- [ ] Version history retained for 1 year

**Success Metrics:**
- Sandbox testing adoption rate: >70% of config changes

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Architecture Principles

**Microservices Architecture**
- 17 specialized microservices + 2 supporting libraries
- Each service owns its domain and database tables
- Event-driven coordination via 23 Kafka topics
- Services communicate asynchronously through events
- Direct service-to-service calls prohibited (except CRM auth callbacks)

**Event-Driven Design**
- All services publish events to Kafka for lifecycle changes
- Consumers are idempotent (can replay events safely)
- Event schema versioning for backward compatibility
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

**Multi-Tenancy**
- Tier 1: Shared infrastructure with Row-Level Security (0-1000 tenants)
- Tier 2: Dedicated namespaces per tenant (1000-5000 tenants)
- Tier 3: Physical isolation for enterprise/regulated (5000+ tenants)

**Performance Optimization**
- Direct LLM integration via @workflow/llm-sdk (200-500ms faster)
- Direct S3 config access via @workflow/config-sdk (50-100ms faster)
- Service consolidation: 22 → 17 services (400-900ms faster workflows)
- Semantic caching with Helicone (40-60% LLM cost reduction)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Critical Risks

#### Risk 1: Multi-Tenancy Data Leakage
- **Probability**: Low (10%)
- **Impact**: Critical (regulatory breach, loss of trust, lawsuits)
- **Mitigation**:
  - PostgreSQL RLS enforced on ALL tables
  - Automated tenant isolation tests on every endpoint (no exceptions)
  - Quarterly security audits by external firms
  - Bug bounty program post-launch ($10K-$50K rewards)
  - Namespace isolation in Qdrant, Neo4j, Redis
- **Contingency**: Immediate incident response, notify affected tenants within 24 hours, offer credit monitoring

---

#### Risk 2: LLM Cost Explosion
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Impact**: High (budget overruns, profitability erosion)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Per-tenant token budgets with hard limits (alert at 80%, throttle at 100%)
  - Semantic caching with Helicone (40-60% cost reduction)
  - Model routing (GPT-3.5 for simple, GPT-4 for complex)
  - Real-time cost dashboards for clients and internal teams
  - Aggressive prompt optimization (reduce tokens per request)
- **Contingency**: Throttle LLM calls per tenant, upgrade pricing tiers, renegotiate with OpenAI for volume discounts

---

#### Risk 3: Latency SLA Violations (Voice Agent)
- **Probability**: Medium (50%)
- **Impact**: High (poor user experience, churn)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Linkerd service mesh (163ms faster than Istio at P99)
  - Direct LLM integration via @workflow/llm-sdk (200-500ms faster)
  - LiveKit optimization with dedicated voice servers
  - Continuous latency monitoring with P95 alerts (<500ms)
  - Streaming LLM responses (reduce perceived latency)
- **Contingency**: Add more Kubernetes nodes, optimize LLM prompts, use smaller models (GPT-3.5 Turbo)

---

#### Risk 4: Team Velocity Lower Than Estimated
- **Probability**: High (70%)
- **Impact**: Medium (delayed timelines, missed revenue targets)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Conservative sprint planning (30% capacity Sprint 1, ramping to 80%)
  - Track velocity weekly and adjust sprint scope
  - AI productivity tools (Claude Code) for 10-20% acceleration
  - Pair programming for knowledge sharing and faster onboarding
  - Weekly retrospectives to identify blockers early
- **Contingency**: Descope non-MVP features, extend timeline by 2-4 weeks, hire contractors for specific tasks

---

### High Risks

#### Risk 5: LLM Hallucination in PRD/Config Generation
- **Probability**: Medium (60%)
- **Impact**: High (incorrect configs, production incidents)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Structured prompts with JSON output format
  - JSON Schema validation before applying configs
  - Human review of first 10 PRDs and configs
  - Confidence scores on AI outputs (reject if <85%)
  - Sandbox testing mandatory before production
- **Contingency**: Fall back to rule-based extraction, require human approval for all AI-generated configs

---

#### Risk 6: CRM Integration Failures
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Impact**: Medium (data inconsistencies, agent frustration)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
  - Conflict resolution with manual review queue
  - CRM sync health dashboard with real-time alerts
  - OAuth token refresh automation
  - Fallback to manual CRM updates via Agent Copilot
- **Contingency**: Temporarily disable CRM sync, fix issues, replay events

---

### Medium Risks

#### Risk 7: Kafka Consumer Lag Accumulation
- **Probability**: Medium (50%)
- **Impact**: Medium (delayed event processing, stale data)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Monitor consumer lag with Prometheus (alert at >100 messages)
  - Auto-scaling consumers based on lag depth
  - Dead letter queues for failed events
  - Kafka topic partitioning for parallelism (10 partitions per topic)
- **Contingency**: Manual replay of missed events, temporary throttling of producers

---

#### Risk 8: Village Knowledge Privacy Concerns
- **Probability**: Low (20%)
- **Impact**: Medium (client distrust, legal issues)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strip PII/company names from all village knowledge data
  - Opt-in only (clients can disable village knowledge contribution)
  - Transparent documentation: "How We Use Your Data"
  - Annual privacy audits
- **Contingency**: Disable village knowledge feature, purge all data, offer refunds to affected clients
