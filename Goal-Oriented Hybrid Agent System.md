PRD — Goal-Oriented Hybrid Agent System

1. Core Idea
A goal-driven management system that can think strategically, act autonomously, and evolve continuously.
The Master Agent converts open-ended business goals into measurable outcomes — interpreting context, analyzing data, writing its own ML/statistical queries, and orchestrating Servant Agents (digital or human).
When the system encounters a gap — a missing capability, dataset, or role — it can request data access from human owners, design new Servant Agents, define their success metrics, and integrate them into future planning.
It’s not automation. It’s adaptive management intelligence — a system that understands goals, learns from reality, and improves itself with every iteration.

2. Philosophy
“The hard thing about hard things isn’t doing tasks — it’s deciding, adapting, and learning when no clear path exists.”
This system embraces ambiguity instead of avoiding it.
It learns through feedback loops, balances machine precision with human judgment, and evolves its own context and memory to stay sharp.
Core beliefs:
Ambiguity is permanent — clarity is built through iteration.
Every failure is structured data, not defeat.
Systems should grow smarter as they operate.
Leadership means context, not control.

3. System Roles
🧠 Master Agent — The Strategic Orchestrator
Purpose: Understand the goal, analyze the environment, plan direction, orchestrate Servants, and own the outcome.
Nature: Context-aware, self-correcting, hybrid-intelligent (Stats + ML + LLM reasoning).
Core Powers:
Data Intelligence: Writes its own declarative statistical and ML queries to derive insights from ERP, CRM, billing, or custom datasets.
Data Access: When new data is required, it can request access from human owners or integration teams.
Context Management: Maintains a compact, structured context window (inspired by Anthropic’s methods). It summarizes, prioritizes, and archives learnings using:
Statistical compaction
Structured note-taking ({situation, action, result, insight})
Dynamic relevance weighting (what to remember, forget, or revisit)
Evaluation Protocols: Before delegating, it sets Evals — clear performance expectations and drift tolerances.
Delegation & Review: Issues missions to Servant Agents, tracks outcomes against Evals, and refines strategies accordingly.
Self-Evolution: Detects missing capabilities and creates new Servant Agents — defining their role, KPIs, and required data inputs.
Replanning Engine: Adjusts what to compute, compact, and focus on based on new signals, data drifts, or market stimuli.

⚙️ Servant Agents — The Execution Specialists
Purpose: Carry out focused sub-goals or campaigns.
Nature: Capability-driven, precise, measurable, and reflective.
Core Powers:
Execute assigned actions — either autonomously or by guiding humans step-by-step.
Measure outcomes and report quantitative and qualitative results.
Structure “unexpected learnings” — insights not planned but discovered in execution.
Send structured feedback to the Master Agent’s Cortext Memory for global learning.
Continuously self-improve at the edge through compacted memory of context-specific tasks.

4. Behavior Loop
GOAL → ANALYZE → PLAN → DELEGATE → EXECUTE → EVAL → REVIEW → REFLECT → REPLAN → (if gap) CREATE NEW AGENT

Each loop improves the system’s intelligence and efficiency.
The Master Agent doesn’t just supervise — it continuously refines its analytical methods, context windows, and even the team structure of agents under it.

5. Key Capabilities
Layer
Capability
Description
Master Agent
Goal Understanding
Converts vague business objectives into measurable OKRs and action frameworks.


Data Access
Requests new datasets or API access when existing data isn’t enough.


Declarative Analysis
Writes and executes its own statistical/ML queries to explore data.


Context Management
Uses structured compaction, note-taking, and context re-weighting to stay relevant.


Evaluation Definition
Sets performance metrics and drift thresholds for Servant tasks.


Delegation & Review
Issues tasks, monitors execution, and compares outcomes against Evals.


Self-Evolution
Detects capability gaps and creates new Servant Agents to fill them.
Servant Agents
Execution
Perform tasks (digital or human-led) with measurable outputs.


Outcome Measurement
Quantify goal performance, efficiency, and quality.


Reflection
Capture new learnings and edge cases as structured feedback.


Reporting
Send summarized learnings upstream to the Master Agent.


6. Example — Samsung India Franchise Store
🎯 Goal: Increase re-orders, upsells, and cross-sells by 20%.
Master Agent: “Store Growth Orchestrator”
Reads billing and ERP data, runs attach-rate analysis, identifies accessory patterns.
Requests additional data access from human owners to retrieve sales-by-staff details.
Writes a declarative statistical query to compare attach rates by salesperson and product category.
Realizes there’s no Servant Agent to track attach performance per staff.
Creates a new Store Staff Performance Agent with defined KPIs and feedback metrics.
Issues new Evals to all Servant Agents (expected attach lift, model precision, staff variance).
Delegates outreach tasks, reviews outcomes, and adjusts targeting logic dynamically.
Compacts all successful strategies into structured notes for replication across regions.
Servant Agents:
ML Insights Agent → Identifies attach bundles by model.
Dialer Agent → Generates customer lists and pitches for sales reps.
QC Agent → Evaluates call tone and persuasion quality.
Trainer Agent → Designs short learning modules for underperforming reps.
(New) Store Staff Performance Agent → Tracks attach success by salesperson, model, and store.
Outcome:
Within two planning cycles, attach rate increases from 3% to 7%.
Unexpected discovery: newer sales staff outperform veterans in high-margin accessories — the system compacts this insight and adjusts training priorities accordingly.

7. Context Management System
Function
Description
Context Compaction
Converts raw logs and analyses into compressed insight blocks.
Structured Note-Taking
Each decision stored as {goal, data_used, action, outcome, learning} for reuse.
Dynamic Relevance
Continuously decides what to keep in memory vs archive based on value to current goal.
Stimulus Replanning
Detects new market signals and adjusts what models, stats, or features to run next.
Cross-Modal Contexting
Handles structured (numeric), unstructured (text), and visual/sensor data seamlessly.


8. System Philosophy & Behavior
Principle
Expression
Clarity over Control
The Master provides context and direction, not micromanagement.
Speed of Learning
Decisions are made early and refined through feedback.
Reality as Feedback
Every failure is structured into system learning.
Hybrid Thinking
Combines quantitative models with reasoning and human inputs.
Self-Expansion
Creates new agents instead of hardcoding new workflows.
Context Discipline
Manages memory actively to remain precise, relevant, and lightweight.


9. Differentiation
Traditional AI Systems

Task automation
Goal-based orchestration
Fixed capabilities
Self-evolving, adds new agents
Predefined data sources
Requests and integrates new data dynamically
Shallow context
Structured, compacted, and evolving memory
Predictive only
Predictive + prescriptive + reflective
Human-bypassing
Human-integrated, data-asking, learning-centered


10. Vision
To build self-learning organizations —
where goals become active,
context is always fresh,
and systems write their own analysis, design their own teams, and improve their own intelligence.
A world where the AI doesn’t just do —
it decides, learns, and builds new capabilities on its own.
